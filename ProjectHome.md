Many instructors teach large classes in rooms that are nearly full to capacity. In this environment, students are seated very close to each other, and it is very easy for them to cheat on exams by looking at other students' answers. Instructors can mitigate this situation by producing multiple versions of exams. Versions may differ in the questions they contain, the order in which the questions appear, the order in which the answers on multiple choice questions appear, or some combination of these. However, creating and managing such multiple versions of exams is a tedious and time-consuming process.

REX is a system for automatically creating multiple randomized versions of an exam that is written in the LaTeX document processing language. It is intended to be used for exams that are mostly (but not necessarily entirely) multiple choice. REX takes two files as input: (1) a Universal Exam File (UEF), which is the "master" exam containing all possible questions and associated meta-data for each question, and (2) an Exam Configuration File, which specifies constraints that must be met in generating randomized exams from the master. The output of REX will consist of a number of latex source files, one for each generated exam, and a corresponding answer key for each exam.
