\section{Introduction}
The REX software package was designed as part of the CISC475 course,
to create a solution for Prof\. Harvey. Prof\. Harvey wishes to create
multiple versions of each exam for the classes he instructs. However,
this can be very time consuming, and as the number of exams created
increases, the amount of effort needed to be exerted to assure the
accuracy of the exams increases proportionally.

We sought to solve these problems for Prof\. Harvey, and created the
REX software as an educational exercise in real-world software
development practices.

The REX software runs without any installation requirements beyond the
need of an appropriate Java VirtualMachine. The REX software will take
UEF File and an ECF File as input, and non-deterministically save
some number of exam files and answer key files in a desired directory.

\section{Overview}
The Rex 

\section{Installation}
The REX software does not require any installation. It is suggested to
place the \texttt{rex.jar} executable in a directory within the user
path on UNIX systems, but this is not necessary for proper operation
of the software.

While REX does not require an installer or any unpacking of it's software,
there must be a version of the Java Runtime Environment installed. The
following list of system requirements must be met in order to run REX.

\subsection{Minimum System Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6:

% do we need memory requirements? like a 1G of ram? -Haley
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building From Source}



\section{Universal Exam File (UEF)}

Please see Figure \ref{fig:SampleUEF} for an example Universal Exam File.

\section{Exam Configuration File (ECF)}
Please see Figure \ref{fig:SampleECF} on page \pageref{fig:SampleECF} for an example Universal Exam File.

The ECF file is a text file with a \texttt{.tex} extension that consists
of a series of constraints. Each constraint is separated by a semicolon,
with comments being all text that follows after a pound symbol 
(\texttt{\#}) until the end of the line.

There are four defined commands for the ECF file

An interval is a pair of decimals separated by two periods, in between a pair of braces or parenthesis, where a brace on an end indicates that edge is inclusive, and a parenthesis that the edge is exclusive. An example would be \texttt{[3..5)}, which would be the range from 3 to 5, including 3 but not including 5.

\subsection{Group Constraints}
A group constraint is a command of the form \texttt{include \textcolor{blue}{int count}
problems on \textcolor{blue}{string topic} with difficulty in \textcolor{blue}{interval difficulty} at \textcolor{blue}{int points} points;}.

The command will choose \textcolor{blue}{count} problems from \textcolor{blue}{topic} 

\subsection{Required Problem Constraints}
A required problem constraint is a command of the form \texttt{includeall \textcolor{blue}{string label} at \textcolor{blue}{int points} points;}.

\subsection{Append Text}
An append text command is a command of the form \texttt{append \textcolor{blue}{string label};}

\subsection{Version Definition}
A version definition of a command of the form \texttt{versions are \textcolor{blue}{string versions};}

\section{Usage}
After creating a UEF and ECF file \texttt{rex input.uef input.ecf}. 
REX will parse the contents of the UEF and ECF and generate the
appropriate number of output exams, as specified in the ECF file.

Please see the following sections for information on UEF and ECF
content format.

\section{Troubleshooting}
Because of the requirements that REX places upon the input it parses,
REX may present the user with a variety of errors. Additionally, it's
possible that REX might process the request without any errors or warnings,
but will provide an undesired output.

\subsection{Errors}
\subsubsection{RexParseException}
This error means that REX encountered a syntactic error in either the
UEF or ECF file. Please consult the provided error message for more
information.

\subsubsection{RexUnsatisfiableException}
This error means that the input files were parsed correctly, but that
REX determined that the requirements from the ECF cannot be resolved
using the provided UEF file. Generally, this means that there aren't
enough problems in the UEF. Either reduce the number of requested
problems in the ECF, or create new problems in the UEF to resolve
this error.

Note: REX resolves the requirements in the ECF simultaneously. This means
that if the ECF has two identical requirements of 5 questions each, REX
will require at least 10 satisfactory questions.



% How do we add color to this to make it easier
% to read? -Haley

% We can add color by using \textcolor{declared-color}{text} - BUT, we can't put that in a verbatim.
% We'd have to escape all the LaTeX commands to use that. We'd have to at the least place a 
% \textbackslash for ever instance of a backslash - \begin, \section, etc.
% Also, I can't find an easy way to make a long section of text appear teletype other than
% using \begin{verbatim}.
