\section*{General Instructions} 

\begin{itemize}
%\footnotesize
\item On the brown multiple choice form, put your UdelNetID 
  where it says ``last name''; put as much as will fit of your last
  name into the space marked ``first name''.
\item Only write your name on the \emph{first} page of this document, in the
  blank provided.
\item Turn off any noise making device, especially \textbf{CELL
  PHONES}. You may lose up to one letter grade if your device disturbs
  the peace of the exam.

\item You have 50 minutes. {\bf Pace yourself,}
and pay attention to the point values.  

\item The exam is \% multiple choice, and \% programming and short
answer.
 
\item \textbf{Do not add features} that are not required by the problem. For
example, if the instructions don't say anything about user input, then
your program should not take user input. If you aren't sure, raise
your hand so that you can \emph{quietly} ask the professor.

\item Do problems you are confident about first. If you finish the
problems you know, write what you do know about other problems to gain
partial credit; but erroneous information may detract from that
credit or irritate the grader, so don't make stuff up. 

\item Read {\em all} the directions {\em carefully} on each problem.

\item Often writing a fast, rough version of a program in English or
pseudocode will make your coding faster and more accurate. It also
enables me to give partial credit in some circumstances.

\item You may assume that input will not produce errors for the
code described, unless the questions say otherwise. 
 
\item Do not do unnecessary testing. For example, testing for both
\verb+x < 0+ and \verb+x >= 0+ instead of using one test and then
\verb+else+ would be considered unnecessary
testing.

\item Have fun!

\end{itemize}
