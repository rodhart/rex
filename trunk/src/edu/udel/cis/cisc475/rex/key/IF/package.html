Provides an interface for utilizing the key module. 
Contains classes for implementing an answer key factory, and new answer keys.  

The answer key module stores information about the answer key in addition to the indexed answers themselves.
These answers can take the form of individual letters or strings of text.
Additionally, a specific problem can have more than one correct answer so the representation
of a given problem will be an array of answers which most of the time will contain only one element.
