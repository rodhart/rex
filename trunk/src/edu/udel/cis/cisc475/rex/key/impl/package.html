Implements keyIF to create a representation of an answer key for a given exam. Stores the version, exam name, and date, as well as the correct answer for each corresponding question.

<h2>Details</h2>
The answer key module stores information about the answer key in addition to the indexed answers themselves.
These answers can take the form of individual letters or strings of text.
Additionally, a specific problem can have more than one correct answer so the representation
of a given problem will be an array of answers which most of the time will contain only one element.

This package stores the answers as a collection of strings. The user can use addProblem() to store more answers into the collection.
