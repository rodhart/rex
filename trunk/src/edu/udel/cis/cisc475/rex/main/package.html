The main module puts all of the other modules together; it takes files
and values (specified on the command line) and attempts to generate
randomized exams. If successful, the exams are output.

<h2>Details</h2>

This module uses almost every other module. While most of the work of the program is
done by other modules, main parses the command line arguments, and handles Rex's different
use cases (see method printUsage). All Rex Exceptions eventually make their way to main,
and are handled accordingly.
