Provides an interface for utilizing the randomization module. Contains classes for implementing a randomizer factory, and new randomizers.

The purpose of the randomizer class is to create an instance of a random object chooser.  It creates
a seeded random number generator and is given a number of elements to pick, along with a range of elements to pick from. It returns the chosen objects.

This class will yield repeatable results given a repeated seed.
