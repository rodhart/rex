Implements the randomIF to create classes that are responsible for a general-purpose seed-based random selector.

The purpose of the randomizer class is to create an instance of a random object chooser.  It creates
a seeded random number generator and is given a number of elements to pick, along with a range of elements to pick from. It returns the chosen objects.

This class will yield repeatable results given a repeated seed.
