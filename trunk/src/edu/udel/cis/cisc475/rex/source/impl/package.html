Implements the sourceIF to create a representation of text from a text file, including line and column information.

The source class holds a body of text, integer values for startLine, startColumn, lastLine, lastColumn, and the file name.  The class
is used to store a body of text and the parameters for the region of text from the file it is from.

The class allows for the building of the body of text via the addText() method.
The other parameters have no bearing on any output and are simply there to hold the values.
