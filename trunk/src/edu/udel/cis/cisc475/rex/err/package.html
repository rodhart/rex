The err module defines the three type of Exceptions specific to Rex. These
Exceptions represent problems with the input UEF and/or ECF file, and are
out of Rex's control.

<h2>Details</h2>

A RexException is a general Exception that serves as a base for the other two
type of Rex specific Exceptions. A RexParseException represents bad input to
either the UEF or ECF file; a typo, mismatched label, or null reference would
fall under this category. A RexUnsatisfiableException is thrown when a particular
constraint cannot be satisfied, either because not enough problems satisfy the
constraint, or certain constraints preclude other constraints from being satisfied.
