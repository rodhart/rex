The Generator module is responsible for generating randomized exams, as
specified by a master exam and a set of constraints in a configuration.

<h2>Details</h2>

The module makes extensive use of several other modules in order to create
exams that are subsets of the master exam. Once finished, Generator will
add to each randomized exam elements in a specific order, in an attempt
to keep problems of the same topic together, problems referring to the same
block together, and problems referring to the same figure together.
Seven container classes aid in the organization of information flowing
through the module.
