Provides simple interfaces that allow for the creation of an ExamIF.
Any Universal Exam File parser should conform to these interfaces. 

<h2>Details</h2>

Any class implementing the UEFParserIF interface will need
to be able to open and correctly parse a tex file that uses 
the exam.cls as a documentclass. It will also need to create 
an internal representation of parsed file using the interfaces 
found within the edu.udel.cis.cisc475.rex.exam.IF package.
